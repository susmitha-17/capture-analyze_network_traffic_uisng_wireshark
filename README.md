# capture-analyze_network_traffic_uisng_wireshark
Monitoring real-time data packets transmitted over a network to understand how communication occurs between devices. Using Wireshark, we can start a live capture on an active network interface (like Wi-Fi or Ethernet) and observe packets as they flow.Each packet contains details such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols used (like TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP), and payload information.               

Analyzing the captured packets provides deep insight into network performance, data flow, and potential issues. For example, network administrators can identify latency problems, dropped packets, or unauthorized access attempts. Cybersecurity analysts can inspect packets for suspicious or malicious activity, such as unencrypted sensitive data or unexpected outbound connections.                           

Overall, capturing and analyzing network traffic with Wireshark develops crucial hands-on skills in network troubleshooting, protocol analysis, and cybersecurity monitoring, which are essential for real-world network management.
